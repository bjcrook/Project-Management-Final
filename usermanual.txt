> HRMS (Human Resource Management System) is an employee management system
  that grants staff with login permissions access to employee records.
> Once logged in, users can: 
  > View and filter tables of employee data.
  > View in depth data on a specific employee.
  > Edit employee data.
  > Add new employees, and remove old employees.
  > View weekly expense reports.


                                          SETUP
                                  *********************
> Clone the github repository https://github.com/bjcrook/Project-Management-Final
> Before an organization can use HRMS for the first time, they must first set
  up a mysql database that they can reliably access.
> The organization will also have to create a password.json file with the list
  of users, and the login password. The form of the json file is as follows:

    // password.json
    {
      "Pw": "{ENTER_PASSWORD_HERE}",
      "Users": [
        {USER_ONE},
        {USER_TWO},
        {ETC}
      ]
    }

> The organization can compile HRMS by running the make.ps1 command in a
  powershell window. Or, if access to powershell is not possible, users should be
  able to copy and paste the command inside the make.ps1 file and run it
  in any terminal. The command is as follows:
    > go build -o server.exe ./BackEnd/handlers.go ./BackEnd/main.go \
      ./BackEnd/model.go ./BackEnd/sql.go

> Once compiled, simply run the program by running the server.exe file the
  powershell script creates.

> Alternatively, you can run the program without creating an executable. Simply run
  the run.ps1 file if you are using power shell. Or else copy and paste the command
  inside the run.ps1 file. The command is as follows:
    > go run ./BackEnd/handlers.go ./BackEnd/main.go ./BackEnd/model.go \
      ./BackEnd/sql.go

                                     APPLICATION USE
